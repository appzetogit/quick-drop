/**
 * Transitional shim: rewrites food vocabulary into quick-commerce vocabulary for the
 * copy still hardcoded inside the shared admin screens.
 *
 * The QC panel deliberately reuses the food admin screens (see AdminRouter), so their
 * copy -- card titles, buttons, empty states -- says "Food" and "Restaurant" in a
 * vertical that sells groceries through sellers. Editing every string is a 165-file
 * change and every new food screen would reintroduce the words, so the swap happens
 * here for now.
 *
 * It is a shim, not the design. The real fix is `translate()` called by the component
 * that owns the string: explicit, testable, and incapable of touching data. The
 * sidebar already works that way -- it relabels the menu tree in React using
 * rulesFor(). Move screens onto that as they are edited, and delete this file once
 * nothing food-worded is left.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT MATTERS
 *
 * This used to rewrite EVERY text node under the subtree, which meant it rewrote data
 * as readily as labels: a seller genuinely named "Restaurant Paradise" rendered as
 * "Seller Paradise", and a customer note mentioning food became one mentioning
 * product. The shim was corrupting the records it was supposed to be labelling, and
 * the original comment shrugged that off as acceptable. It is not -- a support agent
 * reading a mangled seller name back to a customer has no way to know the screen
 * lied to them.
 *
 * isDataNode() now excludes the containers that hold values (table cells, inputs,
 * options, code) while leaving chrome translated. `th` stays translated because a
 * column heading is a label. Anything else that must be left alone opts out with
 * `data-no-vocab`.
