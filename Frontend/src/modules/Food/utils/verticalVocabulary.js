/**
 * Vertical vocabulary: the words a shared screen should use in each vertical.
 *
 * The quick-commerce admin renders the same screens as the food admin, pointed at
 * /v1/qc instead of /v1/food. Those screens are written in food's language -- "Food",
 * "Restaurant" -- in a vertical that sells groceries through sellers.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for that mapping. It is used two ways:
 *
 *   translate()   - for chrome a component renders itself (menu labels, page titles,
 *                   table headers). Preferred: it is explicit, it happens in React,
 *                   and it cannot touch data.
 *   the DOM shim  - VerticalVocabulary.jsx, for the copy still hardcoded inside the
 *                   165 shared screens. Transitional; see the note there.
