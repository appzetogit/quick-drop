/**
 * The Master panel's own menu: everything that is managed once for the whole
 * platform, in the ten groups the business asked for.
 *
 * Kept apart from adminSidebarMenu on purpose. That menu is rebased per
 * vertical -- /admin/food paths are rewritten to /admin/quick-commerce, words
 * like "Food" become "Product", and medical keeps an allowlist -- which is right
 * for screens that exist once per vertical and wrong here: a link to Food's
 * banners must stay Food's banners whichever panel the operator came from.
 *
 * Two kinds of entry:
 *  - /admin/master/* screens hold ONE value for every service (Master settings,
 *    delivery earnings, promo limits, customers, admins).
 *  - "Food · ...", "Quick · ...", "Taxi · ..." entries are the services' own
 *    screens, gathered here so each group is managed from one place. Quick
 *    covers Medical too: pharmacies run on the quick-commerce API and share its
 *    banners, referral, customers and support.
 *
 * Zones are deliberately absent: every service keeps its own map.
 *
 * Every entry is still filtered by the admin's permissions (filterMenuForAccess),
 * so a sub-admin sees only the screens they can open.
