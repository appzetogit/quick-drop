/**
 * Delete every dist asset the current build no longer references.
 *
 * Reachability, not age: chunk filenames are content-hashed, so a chunk that
 * did not change keeps its old filename -- and its old mtime -- across builds
 * while still being referenced. An mtime-based prune (`-mtime +14`) would
 * delete live files. Instead this walks the reference graph from index.html:
 * every `assets/<name>.<hash>.<ext>` mentioned inside a kept file is kept,
 * transitively, and everything else in dist/assets goes.
 *
 * Safe to run while the site is serving. A session still on a pruned build
 * hits a chunk 404, and the stale-build reloader (src/app/staleBuildReload.js)
 * reloads it onto the current build -- that reloader existing is WHY pruning
 * is safe, so do not run this against a deployment that predates it.
 *
 * Runs automatically after `npm run build`; run manually with
 *   node scripts/prune-dist.mjs [--dry-run]
