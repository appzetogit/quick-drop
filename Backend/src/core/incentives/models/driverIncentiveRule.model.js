 * One rung of the ladder: "complete orders fromOrders..toOrders, get
 * rewardAmount" — e.g. 1-5 → ₹100, 5-10 → ₹150, 10-15 → ₹200.
 *
 * toOrders is what crediting actually keys on (see maybeCreditIncentive in
 * incentiveService.js); fromOrders is presentational, so the admin form and
 * the rider's card can both label the band the way it was drawn rather than
 * every screen re-deriving it from the previous tier's toOrders.
 *
 * Kept as its own subdocument (with an _id) rather than a plain object so a
 * credit can reference exactly which tier it paid — DriverIncentiveCredit's
 * idempotency key includes tierId precisely so each tier on the ladder can
 * be credited independently as the rider reaches it, not just the rule as a
 * whole.

 *
 * Edits insert a new active version and deactivate the previous one (see
 * upsertIncentiveRuleController in incentiveController.js) rather than
 * mutating in place — same "latest active wins" pattern as FoodFeeSettings —
