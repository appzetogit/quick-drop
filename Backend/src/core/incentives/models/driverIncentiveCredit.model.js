/**
 * One row per (rider, rule, TIER, day) a reward was actually paid out for.
 *
 * This is the idempotency guard, not just a log: the unique index below is
 * what stops two order-completion events racing to credit the same rider
 * twice for the same tier on the same day. Insert first, credit the wallet
 * only if the insert wins — see maybeCreditIncentive in incentiveService.js.
 *
 * tierId (not just ruleId) is part of the key because a rule is now a
 * ladder of tiers (1-5 → ₹100, 5-10 → ₹150, ...) and each rung is credited
 * independently as the rider reaches it — one row per rung reached, not one
 * row for the whole rule.
 *
 * driverKey is a plain string rather than an ObjectId ref because it can
 * point at three different identities depending on how this rider is
 * provisioned (a unified TaxiDriver, a standalone FoodDeliveryPartner, or a
 * standalone quick-commerce partner) — see resolveDriverContext.
