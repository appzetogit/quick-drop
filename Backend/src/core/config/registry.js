/**
 * Every setting the platform has, declared once.
 *
 * A key/value store without this is a free-for-all: nothing stops a typo creating
 * `cash_limt`, nothing stops a cash limit being saved as the string "2000", and
 * nothing tells the admin panel what to render. The registry is what buys back the
 * schema that a generic store gives away.
 *
 * Each entry declares:
 *   type      how to coerce and validate
 *   default   the value when no level has set one -- so a missing row is never
 *             the same as zero, which is the bug in reading
 *             `Number(settings?.deliveryCashLimit) || 0` as "no limit"
 *   scopes    which levels may set it. Not everything is overridable per partner:
 *             a maintenance switch is global by nature, and offering a partner-level
 *             override for it invites someone to create one that does nothing.
 *   label/help what the panel shows
 *
 * Keys are namespaced `area.name` so the panel can group them without a second
 * table of groupings that drifts from this one.
