/**
 * ✅ NEW: Centralized Razorpay Webhook Handler (Core Layer)
 * Manages atomic updates for order payments and refunds across all modules.
 */
/**
 * Which vertical's order collection this provider event belongs to.
 *
 * There is ONE Razorpay account and one webhook secret, but the platform kept TWO
 * handlers -- master's, reading food_orders, and the quick-commerce fork's, reading
 * qc_orders. Razorpay accepts one URL per event, so whichever handler was not
 * configured simply never ran, and that vertical's orders reconciled only when the
 * customer's app happened to call /verify. Close the app after paying and the money
 * was stranded.
 *
 * So the handler resolves the collection instead of assuming it. Food is tried first
 * because it is the larger table and the common case; a miss costs one indexed
 * lookup. Returning the MODEL rather than a name keeps every query below identical
 * for both verticals -- the alternative is a branch per query, which is how the two
 * handlers drifted apart in the first place.
