 * the 'delivery' capability alone puts nobody in the food pool -- the driver
 * would toggle to Delivery and simply never be offered anything.

 * shape, applied forward at registration instead of retroactively.
 *
 * Idempotent: safe to call on every registration and safe to re-run over

 * Deliberately non-fatal. A driver who cannot be given delivery capability must
 * still finish registering as a taxi driver -- failing the whole signup because
 * the second identity could not be written would be worse than the missing
 * capability, which a backfill can repair later.
