/**
 * Whether an admin may move somebody else's money -- decided, not assumed.
 *
 * Today every financial admin route is gated on `role === 'ADMIN' || 'SUPER_ADMIN'`
 * and nothing else, so any admin account can approve any withdrawal, grant any
 * bonus and credit any wallet. The permission model to stop that already exists
 * (`hasAdminPermission`, and a resource catalog with `wallet` in it) -- it was
 * simply never mounted anywhere.
 *
 * This file is the decision only: pure, no database, no express. The middleware
 * beside it does the loading and the logging. Splitting them is what makes the
 * rule checkable without standing up a request.
 *
 * ROLLOUT, and why it is not just "start returning 403":
 *
 * `permissions` defaults to `[]` on the admin schema, and only the seeded
 * superadmin gets `['*']`. So switching enforcement on in one deploy would lock
 * every existing subadmin out of the withdrawal queue at once -- a self-inflicted
 * outage on the operations team, in exchange for closing a hole that has been open
 * for months. Instead `decide()` reports what it WOULD do, the middleware records
 * every tolerated violation, and enforcement flips only once that list is empty.
