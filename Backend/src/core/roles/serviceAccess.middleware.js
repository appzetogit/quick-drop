/**
 * Server-side enforcement of per-vertical admin access.
 *
 * Until now servicesAccess gated only the sidebar tabs: any admin token reached every
 * vertical's admin API directly, because requireRoles knows roles, not verticals, and
 * hasModuleAccess existed without a single caller. Service-provider was the only
 * vertical that enforced it. This middleware closes that for the rest.
 *
 * The rule matches SP's serviceAccess.js exactly, so one mental model covers the
 * platform: a non-empty servicesAccess must name the vertical; an absent or empty
 * list means unrestricted (legacy admins created before scoping existed).
 *
 * Mounted AFTER authMiddleware + requireRoles('ADMIN'), so req.user is a verified
 * admin token by the time this runs. One indexed lookup per request; results are not
 * cached so a revoked vertical takes effect on the admin's next request, not their
 * next login.
