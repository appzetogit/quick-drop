/**
 * The name a money mutation goes by, so doing it twice does it once.
 *
 * Every financial write in this platform is retryable by something: Razorpay
 * redelivers webhooks, BullMQ retries failed jobs, a rider double-taps, a mobile
 * client resends on a flaky connection, an admin refreshes a form. Today most of
 * those paths protect themselves with `findOne(...)` then write -- two steps with
 * a gap, which two concurrent callers both walk through. (The cash-deposit path
 * is the exception, and the model for this file: it makes the WRITE the claim,
 * backed by a unique index.)
 *
 * This module does not do the writing. It decides the KEY, which is the harder
 * half, because the key is what defines "the same operation":
 *
 *   - too broad, and two legitimately different mutations collapse into one --
 *     a rider who genuinely earns twice on one order gets paid once;
 *   - too narrow, and a retry looks new -- the provider redelivers and the money
 *     moves twice.
 *
 * So there is no universal key. Each operation names itself after whatever the
 * business says makes it unique, which is usually the thing that is already
 * unique upstream: a provider event id, a ride, an order plus the ROLE being
 * paid. Where nothing upstream is unique -- an admin typing an adjustment -- the
 * caller must supply a client-generated id, because the platform genuinely
 * cannot tell a double-click from a deliberate second adjustment of the same
 * amount. Guessing there is worse than asking.
 *
 * Keys are opaque strings, stable across retries and across processes, and
 * carry a prefix so an operator reading the ledger can tell what produced a row.
