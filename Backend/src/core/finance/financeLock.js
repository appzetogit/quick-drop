/**
 * A per-owner lock for money decisions that read a DERIVED balance.
 *
 * A rider's or restaurant's available balance is not a stored number that one
 * atomic $inc could guard -- it is recomputed on every read from orders,
 * bonuses and withdrawal rows. So "is there enough? then create the request"
 * is two steps, and two requests arriving together both read the same balance
 * before either writes: Rs 400 + Rs 400 against Rs 500 both passed, Rs 800 queued.
 *
 * A multi-document transaction would NOT close that gap on its own. Each
 * request only inserts its own new row, so there is no write conflict for the
 * database to detect -- snapshot isolation happily commits both (write skew).
 * What is needed is for the second request to wait until the first has
 * written, then read the balance again. That is what this lock does.
 *
 * Built on the same primitive idempotency.js uses: a unique key, where an
 * E11000 on insert means somebody else holds it. A held lock expires after
 * `holdMs`, so a process that dies mid-request cannot freeze an owner's money
 * forever, and the TTL index sweeps expired rows. Works on a standalone mongod
 * and a replica set alike, so nothing here depends on how production connects.
