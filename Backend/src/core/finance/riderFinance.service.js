/**
 * One rider, one balance, one cash-in-hand -- across taxi, food and groceries.
 *
 * The same person drives a taxi and delivers food, and until now each vertical
 * answered "what do you have?" from its own arithmetic:
 *
 *   taxi  serializeDriverWallet()            -> taxidrivers.wallet.balance
 *   food  getDeliveryPartnerWalletEnhanced() -> derived from orders/bonuses/etc
 *
 * So a driver holding cash from deliveries could still take rides, a rider
 * blocked on the food side saw a healthy taxi wallet, and no screen anywhere
 * showed what the person was actually owed. This module is the single answer
 * both sides now read.
 *
 * Two things had to be reconciled first, and they are the reason this is not
 * simply "add the two numbers":
 *
 * 1. The two sides encode cash-in-hand differently. Food carries an explicit
 *    cashInHand figure. Taxi has no such field -- it encodes cash the rider owes
 *    as a NEGATIVE wallet balance, blocking once the balance falls to
 *    minimumBalanceForOrders (a negative number, e.g. -500). So the signed taxi
 *    balance is two figures superimposed, and is split apart below: the positive
 *    part is money owed TO the rider, the negative part is cash owed BY them.
 *
 * 2. Nothing needed migrating. food_delivery_wallets is a designed-but-dead
 *    collection -- zero documents, no reader, no writer -- and the food side has
 *    always derived its wallet on read. The taxi ledger (wallettransactions)
 *    agrees with its snapshot to the rupee. So unification is a read-path change,
 *    not a data move, and there is no cutover to stage.
 *
 * Deliberately depends on MODELS ONLY, never on the two wallet services that now
 * call it -- otherwise walletService -> riderFinance -> walletService. The few
 * service-level helpers it does need are pulled in with dynamic import inside the
 * function, the pattern order.service.js already uses for the same reason.
