/**
 * Which zone a point belongs to when zones overlap: the most specific one.
 *
 * Zones were drawn per city and never overlapped, so every lookup simply took
 * the first zone containing the point. A country-wide zone ("India", one per
 * service) overlaps all of them -- and the first-match order is whatever the
 * database returns (by name, insertion or index order), so it could beat
 * Palampur or Indore and switch off their fees, incentives, service switches
 * and rider matching. Smallest first keeps every city zone winning inside its
 * own boundary; the country-wide zone only answers where no city zone does.
 *
 * Food, Quick and Medical rings are [{ latitude, longitude }]. Taxi stores
 * GeoJSON and lets Mongo match, so its lookups sort on `isCountryWide`
 * instead (see TAXI_SPECIFIC_FIRST).
