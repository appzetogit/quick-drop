/**
 * Runs every BullMQ worker in one process.
 *
 * Why this file exists: package.json declares six worker entrypoints, and
 * deploy/ecosystem.config.cjs started none of them. With BULLMQ_ENABLED=true the API
 * would keep enqueuing OTP sends, order dispatch retries, tracking updates and
 * payment reconciliation into queues that nothing consumed -- growing forever, with
 * no error surfacing anywhere, because a producer succeeds whether or not a consumer
 * exists.
 *
 * One process rather than six pm2 apps: these workers are I/O-bound on Redis and
 * MongoDB, so they interleave on one event loop, and six Node runtimes to do that is
 * ~300MB of resident memory for no throughput. Split one out into its own pm2 app if
 * a specific queue ever needs isolation or its own concurrency.
 *
 * WORKER_BUNDLE tells each worker module not to install its own SIGTERM handler.
 * Six handlers each ending in process.exit(0) means the first worker to finish
 * closing terminates the process while the others are still draining jobs.
 *
 * Run:  node src/queues/workers/index.js      (or: npm run worker:all)
