/**
 * Refund arithmetic for quick-commerce returns.
 *
 * Pure functions, no database, no I/O — so the money rules can be tested exhaustively
 * and read in one sitting. Everything that touches an order or writes a record lives
 * in return.service.js.
 *
 * Two decisions drive the whole file:
 *
 * 1. All arithmetic runs in integer paise. Rupee floats do not survive proportional
 *    splits: 0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3, and a discount apportioned across five lines drifts
 *    by a paisa or two per line. Over a month of returns that is a reconciliation
 *    mismatch nobody can explain. Values arrive and leave as rupees; the conversion
 *    happens at the boundary.
 *
 * 2. A partial return refunds the customer's *effective* price for the returned
 *    lines, not the list price. If a 500 coupon was applied to a 2000 order, the
 *    customer paid 1500. Refunding the full line price on a partial return hands back
 *    more than was collected, and repeating that with a discounted cart is a way to
 *    extract money from the platform.

 * independently does not add up — five lines of 33.33% of 100 leaves a paisa
 * unallocated, and that paisa is what makes a refund total disagree with the sum of
