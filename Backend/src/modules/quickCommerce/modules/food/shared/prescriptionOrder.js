/**
 * Rules for a prescription-only order — the one a customer places by
 * photographing a doctor's prescription, with no items and no price.
 *
 * The ordinary order path cannot express this. It builds an order from catalogue
 * lines and prices it before the customer confirms; here nobody knows what is
 * being sold until the pharmacist has read the photograph. So the order is
 * created empty and priced later, by the seller, in a second step:
 *
 *   customer  photo + address        -> order, no items, total 0
 *   pharmacist reads the photo       -> approves or rejects the prescription
 *   pharmacist enters what they will dispense -> items + price land on the order
 *   pharmacist accepts               -> normal lifecycle from here on
 *
 * Two consequences fall out of that and are enforced below. The order is cash on
 * delivery, because there is nothing to charge at placement. And it may not be
 * accepted until it has been priced, or the customer would be committed to an
 * order whose cost nobody has told them.
 *
 * Pure, so the same rules serve the customer path, the seller path and the admin
 * panel without a database.
