/**
 * Cancel a booking nobody accepted in time, and refund a prepaid customer.
 *
 * Moved out of bookingScheduler so it can be tested, and rewritten because the
 * refund inside it had never once run:
 *
 *  - It checked `paymentStatus === 'SUCCESS'`. The stored value is 'success'
 *    (PAYMENT_STATUS.SUCCESS), so the condition was always false: every prepaid
 *    booking that timed out was cancelled and its customer kept nothing.
 *  - Its method list also omitted 'online', what a Razorpay payment stores.
 *  - Had it matched, it would have failed worse: it credited the wallet by
 *    read-modify-save, wrote the refund row, and THEN set paymentStatus 'REFUNDED'
 *    -- not in the enum -- so the final save threw after the money had moved,
 *    leaving a booking still marked paid and refundable again next tick.
 *
 * Now one transaction claims the booking (still searching, still unassigned, so a
 * partner accepting at the same moment wins cleanly), credits the wallet with
 * $inc, and writes the refund row with before/after. The claim makes it safe to
 * run from every scheduler tick and every instance.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<{ cancelled: boolean, refundAmount: number }>}
