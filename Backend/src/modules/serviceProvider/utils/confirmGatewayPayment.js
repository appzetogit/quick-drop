/**
 * Confirm a Razorpay payment against the gateway.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * A valid razorpay_signature only proves that `order_id|payment_id` came from
 * Razorpay. It says nothing about how much was paid or what was being bought.
 * Every verify endpoint that read the amount — or a planId — out of req.body was
 * therefore exploitable: pay for the ₹99 plan, claim the ₹9999 one.
 *
 * So the amount and the purchase details are read back from the gateway instead.
 * `notes` are set by us at order-creation time and cannot be influenced by the
 * client, which makes them the authoritative record of what the order was for.
 *
 * Returns either:
 *   { ok: true,  amount, notes, payment, mock }
 *   { ok: false, status, message }
 */

/**
 * Dev/mock escape hatch, mirroring verifyPayment()'s existing behaviour of
 * accepting `order_mock_*` ids. Fail-closed: never active in production, so a
 * misconfigured live server rejects payments instead of trusting the client.

/**
 * Mirror a confirmed gateway payment into the shared `payments` collection, so
 * service-provider revenue appears in the cross-vertical totals alongside food and
 * quick-commerce.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a move of `sp_transactions`. That collection is a wallet
 * LEDGER -- balanceBefore/balanceAfter, and 17 type values of which most are internal
 * movements (commission, settlement, tds_deduction, earnings_credit). Only a handful
 * are gateway events. The ledger keeps its own collection and is untouched here; this
 * records the gateway payment, which is a different aggregate.
 *
 * Never throws. A reporting write must not be able to fail a payment the customer has
 * already made and the gateway has already captured -- the money moved regardless.
