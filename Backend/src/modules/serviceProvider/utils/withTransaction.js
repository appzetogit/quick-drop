/**
 * Multi-document transaction helper for money paths.
 *
 * Every money flow here touches several collections at once — a booking, a
 * Transaction row, a partner wallet, a bill. Without a transaction a mid-flight
 * failure leaves those out of sync: cash collected but no earning credited, a
 * wallet debited for a booking that never got marked paid.
 *
 * USAGE — the callback receives a session and MUST thread it through every
 * single query it makes, or that query silently runs outside the transaction:
 *
 *   const out = await withTransaction(async (session) => {
 *     await Booking.findByIdAndUpdate(id, { ... }, { session });
 *     await Vendor.findByIdAndUpdate(vid, { $inc: {...} }, { session });
 *     const [txn] = await Transaction.create([{ ... }], { session });  // NOTE: array form
 *     return txn;
 *   });
 *
 * GOTCHA — Model.create(doc, { session }) does NOT work. That signature means
 * "create two documents". Always use the array form: Model.create([doc], { session }).
 *
 * GOTCHA — side effects that cannot be rolled back (push notifications, socket
 * emits, SMS, Razorpay API calls) belong OUTSIDE the callback. Do the DB work in
 * the transaction, then fire notifications after it commits.
 *
 * RETRIES — session.withTransaction() re-runs the callback on transient errors
 * (write conflicts, primary step-down). Keep the callback free of side effects
 * and safe to run twice.
