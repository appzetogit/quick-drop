/**
 * Customer identity bridge: master `users` -> SP `sp_users`.
 *
 * The super app logs a customer in ONCE, through master's
 * `POST /api/v1/food/auth/user/verify-otp`. That mints
 * `{ userId: <users._id>, role: 'USER' }` signed with `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` --
 * the same secret SP's tokenService resolves (see tokenService.js). So the
 * token VERIFIES here; it just points at a document in the shared `users`
 * collection, while SP reads `sp_users`. Without a bridge every SP call from
 * the super app 401s with "User not found", and the socket joins
 * `user_<masterId>` while the server emits to `user_<spUserId>` -- so the
 * customer silently never receives booking updates.
 *
 * Plan SERVICE_PROVIDER_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md §4.2 fixes this properly by moving
 * SPUser onto `collection: 'users'` behind a data migration. That is Phase 2
 * and has a schema-shape trap (`addresses[]` differs between the two, and SP's
 * `name` is required where master's is optional), so it is deliberately not
 * done here.
 *
 * This is the same shape as the driver identity bridge that already shipped on
 * k9 (docs/superapp/13-driver-identity-bridge.md): resolve in the middleware,
 * keep ONE login, ONE token, ONE socket. The alternative -- minting a second
 * SP-issued token and having the app hold both -- was considered and rejected
 * there for forcing two sockets and two sessions that expire out of step.
 *
 * Properties:
 *  - Additive. An SP-native token still resolves through the normal
 *    `SPUser.findById` path and never reaches this file.
 *  - Matched on the last 10 digits of the phone, so `+91XXXXXXXXXX`,
 *    `91XXXXXXXXXX` and `XXXXXXXXXX` are one account.
 *  - Auto-provisions on first use, so an existing food/taxi customer can open
 *    the Services tab and book without a second registration.
