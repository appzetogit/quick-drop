/**
 * When a coupon counts as used, and when it stops counting.
 *
 * Usage used to be counted the moment an order document was created, including
 * an online checkout the customer then abandoned at the payment sheet. That use
 * was never given back. A first-order coupon was gone after a failed payment,
 * and a limited coupon ran out on attempts nobody paid for.
 *
 * The rule now: a use counts once the order is real, and is given back if the
 * order is cancelled.
 *
 *   cash / wallet / QR   counted at placement, before the order is saved, so
 *                        the usage cap is enforced atomically (see createOrder)
 *   razorpay (online)    marked `pending` at placement and counted only when
 *                        the payment is verified -- by the app's /verify call
 *                        or the gateway webhook, whichever arrives first
 *   any cancellation     gives back a use that was counted
 *
 * `order.couponUsage` records the state, and every transition is a conditional
 * update on it. /verify and the webhook can race, and a cancel can arrive twice,
 * but each use is counted at most once and given back at most once.
