/**
 * Short-lived cache of admin documents, keyed by admin id.
 *
 * attachFoodAdminContext runs on EVERY request under /v1/food/admin -- roughly 300
 * routes -- and fetched the full admin document each time. An operator working
 * through the panel generates one of these per click, per background poll, per table
 * page. The document changes only when someone edits that admin.
 *
 * Correctness comes from invalidation, not from the TTL: mutating an admin calls
 * invalidateAdminCache(), so a permission change or a deactivation takes effect on
 * the admin's very next request. The TTL is a backstop for changes made outside this
 * process -- a direct database edit, or the other pm2 instance -- and is deliberately
 * short because the worst case it bounds is a deactivated admin retaining access.
 *
 * ponytail: process-local Map, so each pm2 instance keeps its own copy and an
 * invalidation only clears the instance that served the write. The 15s TTL is what
 * bounds that. Move to Redis pub/sub if the admin count or instance count grows
 * enough for the window to matter.
