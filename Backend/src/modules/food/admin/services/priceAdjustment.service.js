 * menu is not always uniform -- an earlier per-restaurant run may have touched

 * over there has" is a guess.
 *
 * Included: every formulation run that is not itself a revert and has not been
 * reverted, scoped either to this restaurant or to all restaurants. Increases
 * add to the markup, decreases to the discount, matching how a run accumulates.
 *
 * Excluded: the older `scale` and `markdown` runs. Those multiplied stored
 * prices rather than recording a percent, so there is no total to inherit --
 * and a dish created today was never part of what they did.
