 * documents, identical for everyone. A car driver was offered "bicycle", a
 * parcel driver was never offered a truck, and nobody could be asked for a
 * commercial badge without a new app release.
 *
 * Both lists are admin data: the vehicle catalogue and the needed-document
 * catalogue, filtered by what the driver said they have. Adding an "EV Scooty"
 * or a "Goods permit" in the panel reaches the next applicant with no release.
