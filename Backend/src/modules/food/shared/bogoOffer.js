/**
 * "Buy 1, get 1 free."
 *
 * A restaurant nominates dishes and a ratio; the server hands out the free units
 * from the quantity actually ordered. Nothing the client sends decides how many
 * units are free, for the same reason the spend-threshold freebie is resolved
 * server-side -- a client that could ask for free units would ask for all of them.
 *
 * Three rules do the work here:
 *
 *   Free units come out of the SAME line, not from a new one the customer never
 *   ordered. Two pizzas in the cart means one paid pizza and one free pizza, not
 *   two paid pizzas plus a bonus. So the line is split rather than discounted.
 *
 *   That split is what keeps the money right downstream. Commission is taken on
 *   pricing.subtotal, and the POS is sent price x quantity per line, so a line
 *   left at full quantity with a discount bolted on would charge the restaurant
 *   commission on food it gave away and desynchronise the POS total. A zero-
 *   priced line is subtracted from both by construction.
 *
 *   Only the item price is given away. Add-ons and packaging ride along on the
 *   free line at their real values: extra cheese on a free pizza is still cheese
 *   somebody has to pay for, and the free pizza still leaves in a box.
