/**
 * How far a restaurant delivers: "we serve within 10 km of the kitchen."
 *
 * One rule, one place. The number lives on the restaurant document
 * (`serviceRadiusKm`) and nowhere else. The restaurant app and the admin panel
 * both write it through the same service (restaurant/services/serviceRadius.
 * service.js), which validates it here, so neither side can store something the
 * other would have refused. Everything that reads it -- the customer listing,
 * the cart quote, order placement -- resolves it here too, so a restaurant can
 * never be listed by one rule and refused by another.
 *
 * The radius narrows the zone; it does not replace it. An address still has to
 * be inside the zone the admin drew AND within the restaurant's radius.
 *
 * Unset (null) is what every restaurant had before this existed and means "no
 * radius of our own -- the zone decides", so adding the field changes no
 * listing and refuses no order until somebody deliberately sets it.
 *
 * The platform ceiling (`maxRadiusKm`) is admin-owned. It bounds what can be
 * saved, and it also bounds what is enforced: an admin who lowers the ceiling
 * to 8 km does not have to chase every restaurant that had saved 12 -- they are
 * served at 8 until they choose otherwise, and their own 12 is kept, so raising
 * the ceiling again restores it.
 *
 * This module is pure -- no database, no request -- so the rule can be tested
 * on its own.
