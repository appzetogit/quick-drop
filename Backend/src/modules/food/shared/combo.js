/**
 * Combos: several existing dishes sold together as one menu entry at a fixed price.
 *
 * "Burger + Fries + Coke -- Rs 199". The restaurant picks dishes it already sells;
 * a combo never introduces a new dish, it only groups them. Two dishes is the
 * common case and the minimum -- a combo of one is just a dish with a discount,
 * and there are already three ways to do that.
 *
 * This module is pure: no database, no Express, no Mongoose. Everything it needs
 * arrives as arguments, which is what makes the rules below testable in isolation
 * (see __checks__/combo.check.js). The service layer resolves prices and
 * availability from the menu and hands the results in.
 *
 * The one genuinely awkward problem here is splitting money. A combo is charged as
 * a single fixed price, but the platform still has to know what each component was
 * worth: commission is taken per line and the POS is sent per-dish rows. So the
 * fixed price is allocated back across the components in proportion to their list
 * prices, with the rounding remainder handed to one component so the parts always
 * sum to exactly the price the customer paid. Getting that wrong is how a bill
 * ends up a paisa short of itself.
