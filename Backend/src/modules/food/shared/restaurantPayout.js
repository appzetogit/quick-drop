/**
 * What the restaurant earns on one order, line by line.
 *
 * The restaurant app used to show the CUSTOMER's bill -- delivery fee, platform
 * fee, grand total -- none of which is the restaurant's money. This is the
 * other side of the same order: what was sold, what of it is tax, what the
 * platform takes, and what is paid out.
 *
 * The lines are derived from the figures stored on the order, and the total
 * they add up to is the same `restaurantNet` the payout ledger credits
 * (orders/services/foodTransaction.service.js). Anything shown to a restaurant
 * that its payout does not match is worse than showing nothing.
 *
 * Two shapes, because a GST-inclusive menu is a different sum:
 *
 *   prices exclude GST        prices include GST
 *   ------------------        ------------------
 *   Sub total       100.00    Sub total (GST incl)   100.00
 *   GST @5%           5.00    GST @5% included        -4.76
 *     collected from the        Taxable food value     95.24
 *     customer, paid to
 *     the government
 *   Packing         + 5.00    Packing               + 5.00
 *   Commission 10%  -10.00    Commission 10%         -9.52
 *   PAY TO YOU       95.00    PAY TO YOU             90.72
 *
 * Extracting a tax is not the same sum as adding one: 100 x 5% is 5.00, but
 * 100 - 100/1.05 is 4.76. The inclusive column uses the extraction, which is
 * what the bill charged and what the ledger pays.
