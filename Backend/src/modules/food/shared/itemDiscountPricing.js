/**
 * Base price + discount, the way an item is priced now.
 *
 * A restaurant types what the dish is worth (`basePrice`, say 50) and how much
 * off they are giving (`discountPercent`, say 20). The customer pays `price`
 * (40), and 50 is what gets struck through next to it.
 *
 * `price` stays the authoritative selling price, exactly as it was before this
 * field pair existed. That is deliberate and load-bearing: order subtotals,
 * commission, payouts and every cart total already read `price`, so pricing an
 * item this way changes what those numbers are without changing any of that
 * code. In particular the platform commission is charged on what the customer
 * actually pays (40), not on the pre-discount sticker (50), because commission
 * is taken from the order subtotal and the subtotal is built from `price`.
 *
 * This replaces the older pair of compare-at fields:
 *   mrp        - the printed maximum retail price, enforced as a legal ceiling
 *   otherPrice - a rival platform's price, purely presentational
 * Both existed only to produce a struck-through number. `basePrice` produces the
 * same strikethrough from a figure the restaurant sets itself, so the two are
 * no longer written by the item forms. The columns are left on the schema so
 * existing rows keep their data rather than being silently erased.
