/**
 * Idempotency middleware for state-changing endpoints.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *  - No `Idempotency-Key` header  -> pass through unchanged. This is what makes the
 *    middleware safe to mount on live endpoints today: every existing client, including
 *    the shipped Flutter and seller-APK builds, keeps working exactly as before, and
 *    gains protection only once it starts sending the header.
 *  - First request with a key      -> executes, and the response is stored.
 *  - Retry with the same key       -> replays the stored response, no re-execution.
 *  - Same key, different body      -> 422. That is a client bug, not a retry, and
 *                                     replaying the first response would silently
 *                                     discard the second request.
 *  - Retry while the first is still running -> 409, so the caller retries rather than
 *                                     running the same mutation twice concurrently.
 *
 * Failures here FAIL OPEN. A ledger outage must not take down order creation; the
 * worst case is the duplicate protection this middleware adds being unavailable,
 * which is where the system was before it existed.
 *
 * Mount on the money paths: order creation, payment verification, refunds, wallet
 * movements, withdrawals, coupon redemption.
