/**
 * The delivery fee has to follow where the customer actually is.
 *
 * Two clients send the delivery address two different ways: the web sends the
 * whole address object, the Flutter app sends `deliveryAddressId` -- the id of
 * one of the user's saved addresses. Only the first was ever read, so every
 * cart priced from the app arrived with no coordinates, fell to the base
 * distance slab, and was quoted the same fee from 1 km as from 12. Free
 * delivery by radius could never qualify either, because an unmeasured
 * distance does not.
 *
 * It got worse at the end: `POST /food/orders` re-prices, and the app DOES send
 * a full address with coordinates there -- so the customer was shown the base
 * slab and charged the real one.
 *
 * Run:  node tests/delivery-distance.smoke.mjs
